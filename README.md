# SLEEP APNEA AHI CALCULATOR

A polynomial regression model that predicts an AHI (Apnea Hypopnea Index) based on age and BMI values for men.

## Description

This model is for general use (not clinical use) to allow men to calcuate a predicted value of AHI to give an estimation of the risk of possible sleep apnea.

### Dependencies

these required rependencies for this project

numpy
matplotlib
pandas
scikit-learn
keras
pydot
graphviz
pydot-ng
pillow
pydotplus

### Installing

run the module installer:

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Executing program

run the program polyAHI.py

input your age

input your BMI

will return a predicted AHI result

## Help

this model does not have enough data, as such it is not very accurate and will sometimes return negative values
